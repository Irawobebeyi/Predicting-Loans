# Unit 19: Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to
You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.


PREDICTIONS

I strongly believe that the Random Forest Classifier would give a better result than the Logistic Regression Model.



RESULTS 
The RFC model score is 0.9922100701609575 and LFC model score is 0.9924680148576145.


CONCLUSION

The machine Language algorithims Ramdom Forest Classifier (RFC) and Logistics Regression Model(LFC) are used for different disciplines for classification and regression purposes.
The RFC model score is 0.9922100701609575 and LFC model score is 0.9924680148576145.

This doesnt do justice to my prediction. I predicted that RFC would do better but LFC did better.
